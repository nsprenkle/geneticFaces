# Genetic Faces
This is a program built for my soft computing class experimenting with genetic algorithms in producing attractive faces.
The program produces an initial set of faces randomly drawn from all of the possible features, and uses human-in-the-loop genetic algorithms to create more attractive faces by combining features from different faces rated attractive by the user.

Faces are drawn using features copied from Nintendo's Mii creation software.
Mii and related images are the property of Nintendo, and are being borrowed for initial testing of the program.
